# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

A classic data science project predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Python and machine learning.  
This notebook walks through the complete data science workflow â€” from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project explores the **Titanic dataset** to predict survival using a range of supervised learning algorithms.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Extract titles and family information  
   - Encode categorical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize survival distribution by gender, class, and age  
   - Understand correlations between key variables  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create meaningful new features (e.g., family size, title encoding)  
   - Scale numeric data for model training  

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Compare multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, MLP, etc.  
   - Use cross-validation for fair model comparison  
   - Evaluate accuracy and F1-score  

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**  
   - Identify which factors most influenced survival
